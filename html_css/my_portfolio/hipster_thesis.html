	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
	<p id="first">By Harsh Patel</p>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Hipster refer to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> of young, urban middle class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the 1990s. The subculture is associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, progressive[1][2] or independent political views, alternative spirituality, or atheism/agnosticism, and alternative lifestyles. Interests in media include independent film, magazines such as Clash, and websites like Pitchfork Media.</p>
	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
	<p>Hipster culture has been descrived as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic meltimg pot of styles, tastes, and behavior[s]".[3] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out Ne York argues that the "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" element of all the "fringe movements of the postwar era beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", and "regurgitates it with a winking inauthentcity".</p>
